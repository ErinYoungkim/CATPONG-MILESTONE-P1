# CATPONG-MILESTONE-P1
A pawsitively adorable ping pong game!

grab a friend and play together on one keyboard!

My journey and reflection during the making of this game:
I struggle with JavaScript and felt like maybe having a game that dealt with collision would challenge me in ways I could handle and BOY was I right! This game was more challenging than I anticipated and it was a great way to see my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to software development. I love CSS! During my journey, I wanted to show off some of my CSS during this game! I think that this project inspired me to go back and keep working on it and how there's always something to work on and do! I went into this game not even touching the game functionality yet since I was too intimidated to get into it and I just knew the inevitable was coming. My doomsday has soon arrived! Thankfully I had amazing instructors and classmates who were willing to help me out and debug my code after countless hair-pulling and tear-covered keyboards HAHA. It was a great experience for my first milestone project where I have free reign in my creation! 

All the png files in my assets were hand-drawn by yours truly! Hopped on my iPad and started creating assets on Procreate since I didn't want to pay for any assets for this project especially if I could show off some of my artistic abilities! 
I used pixabay to grab some of the music assets. The home page background music is: https://pixabay.com/music/future-bass-viyn-cotton-candy-loop-version-13253/
